# Production ML workflows on Google Cloud

This repo manages a set of labs designed to demonstrate best practices and patterns for implementing and operationalizing production grade ML workflows on Google Cloud Platform.

With few exceptions the labs are self-contained - they don't rely on other labs. The goal is to create a portoflio of labs that can be utilized in development and delivery of scenario specific demos and workshops. 

- **Lab-00- Environment Setup**. This lab guides you through the process of provisioning and configuring of a reference MLOps environment. Most other labs rely on this environment. 

- **Lab-01-KFP_AutoML**. This lab demonstrates how to use Kubeflow Pipelines to orchestrate an ML workflow that utilizes BigQuery for feature engineering and AutoML Tables for model training and deployment.
