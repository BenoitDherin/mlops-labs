# Production ML workflows on Google Cloud

This repo manages a set of labs designed to demonstrate best practices and patterns for implementing and operationalizing production grade ML workflows on Google Cloud Platform.

As much as feasible the labs are self-contained - they don't rely on other labs. The goal is to create a portoflio of labs that can be utilized to support development and delivery of scenario specific demos and workshops.
